This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in PHP: using unset() within a foreach loop on an array.  The issue arises when removing elements from the array during iteration, as this changes the array's internal structure and can cause elements to be skipped.

The `bug.php` file illustrates the problem. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution by first identifying the keys to remove and then removing them in a separate loop, ensuring that all elements are processed correctly.

This example highlights the importance of understanding how PHP handles array iteration and modification.  Always consider potential side effects when altering the structure of an array during a loop.
